****Cryptotop*** is a web application for users who are interested in viewing the top cryptocurrencies.

I've personally always had an interest in investing, and I began this project during the time when Crypto's were about to become popular. I figured it'd be a great project idea that already aligns with one of my interests. A live link of my project is located [here](https://michael-m-aguilar.github.io/cryptotop/). 

Some of the technologies used for this project is: 
* JavaScript
* AJAX
* CSS
* Flexbox
* HTML
* jQuery
* localStorage
* API Requests via XML.

Using these technologies the features of this project were: 
1. User can view a list of crypto's from the market.
2. User can create their own notes for each individual stock.
3. User will be able to determine if a crypto price change is neutral, positive, or negative.
4. User can click on a crypto to view some additional information.
5. User can sort the table in a variety of ways, whether alphabetically, by ranks, prices, or percentage rises or drops.

Some features which I'd like to implement in the near future are: 
1. Make a new API request to use the data to then create a historical chart via Chart.js for each crypto.
2. Use different API to help retrieve cryptocurrency news.
3. Look to insert more investing market statistics.

To begin using ***Cryptotop***, no setting up is needed to begin using the app. The website serves to keep an eye on the current prices, and price movements for each of the top 15 strongest cryptocurrencies. The crypto's that have external links such as Twitter, Blockchair, or their own respective website will already be available when clicking on a crypto. Any notes will be saved on the localStorage and will be saved to their respective crypto.
